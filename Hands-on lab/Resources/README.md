# NOTES

Two PowerShell scripts are used to bootstrap the Host VM. They download and deploy the nested Hyper-V VMs that constitute the 'on-premises' environment.

A third script is used by students during the lab to enable the networking for the Azure Migrate appliance.

These scripts are copied to the cloudworkshop storage account, and used from there.

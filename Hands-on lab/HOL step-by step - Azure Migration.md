# Line of business application migration hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to assess and migrate a multi-tier application from Hyper-V to Azure. You will learn the various Azure tools available for different steps of the migration, and walk through using each of those tools.

After this hands-on lab, you will know the role of each of the migration tools and how to use them to successfully migrate an on-premises multi-tier application to Azure.

## Overview

Before the lab, you will have pre-deployed an on-premises infrastructure hosted in Hyper-V.  This infrastructure is hosting a multi-tier application called 'SmartHotel', using Hyper-V VMs for each of the application tiers.

During the lab, you will migrate this entire application stack to Azure. This will include assessing the on-premises application using Azure Migrate; migrating the database tier to Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Data Migration Assistant (DMA) and the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS); and migrating the web and application tiers using Azure Site Recovery. This includes migration of both Windows and Linux VMs.


## Solution architecture

The SmartHotel application comprises 4 VMs hosted in Hyper-V:
- **Database tier** Hosted on the smarthotelSQL1 VM, which is running Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017
- **Application tier** Hosted on the smarthotelweb2 VM, which is running Windows Server 2012R2.
- **Web tier** Hosted on the smarthotelweb1 VM, which is running Windows Server 2012R2.
- **Web proxy** Hosted on the  UbuntuWAF VM, which is running Nginx on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

(For simplicity, there is no redundancy in any of the tiers.)

**Note:** For convenience, the Hyper-V host itself is deployed as an Azure VM. For the purposes of the lab, you should think of it as an on-premises machine.

![](Images/overview.png)

To assess the Hyper-V environment, you will use Azure Migrate. This includes deploying the Azure Migrate appliance on the Hyper-V host to gather information about the environment. For deeper analysis, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent will be installed on the VMs, enabling the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

The SQL Server database will be assessed by installing the Microsoft SQL Server Data Migration Assistant (DMA) on the Hyper-V host, and using it to gather information about the database. The DMA will also be used to migrate the database schema to Azure SQL Database. Data migration will then be completed using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).

The application, web, and web proxy tiers will be migrated to Azure VMs using Azure Site Recovery (ASR). This includes deploying the ASR collector appliance into the Hyper-V environment, building the Azure environment, replicating data to Azure, and performing a failover to migrate the application to Azure.

**Note:** After migration, the application could be modernized to use Azure Application Gateway instead of the Ubuntu Nginx VM, and to use Azure App Service to host both the web tier and application tier. These optimizations are out of scope of this lab, which is focused only on a 'lift and shift' migration to Azure VMs.

## Requirements

1.  You will need Owner or Contributor permissions for an Azure subscription to use in the lab.

2.  Your subscription must have sufficient unused quota to deploy the VMs used in this lab.

3.  Your subscription must be registered for the Azure Migrate v2 Preview.

For further details, see [Before the HOL - Line of Business Application Migration](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Azure%20Migration.md).

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the [Before the HOL - Line of Business Application Migration](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Azure%20Migration.md) setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

**Allow at least 60 minutes to deploy the on-premises environment before you start the lab.**

## Exercise 1: Discover and assess the on-premises environment

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Azure Migrate to assess the on-premises environment.

### Task 1: Create the Azure Migrate project

In this task, you will create the Azure Migrate project and select the migration assessment tool.

1.  Open your browser and navigate to http://aka.ms/migrate/preview. This special link is used during the Azure Migrate v2 preview phase to access the Azure Portal with the Azure Migrate v2 service enabled.

2.  Click **All services**, then search for and select  **Azure Migrate** to open the Azure Migrate Overview blade, shown below.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate overview blade](Images/Exercise1/azure-migrate-overview.png)

3.  Click the **Add tool(s)** button to open the 'Add a tool' wizard at the 'Migrate project' step.  Select your subscription and create a new resource group named **AzureMigrateRG**. Choose a geography close to you to store the migration assessment data (Note: options may be limited during the preview phase).

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Migrate project' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-1.png)

    Click **Next**.

4.  At the 'Select assessment tool' step, select **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Select assessment tool' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-2.png)

5.  At the 'Select migration tool' step, check the **Skip adding a migration tool for now** checkbox, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Select migration tool' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-3.png)

6.  At the 'Review + add tool(s)' step, review the settings and click **Add tool(s)**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Review + Add tool(s)' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-4.png)

7.  The Azure Migrate deployment will start. Once it has completed, click on the **Servers** panel of the Azure Migrate blade. Select your subscription and the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group from the drop-downs. You should now see 'Azure Migrate: Server Assessment', as shown below.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Servers' blade, showing the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment tool for the selected subscription and resource group](Images/Exercise1/servers.png)

### Task 2: Deploy the Azure Migrate appliance

In this task, you will deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs.

1.  Click **Discover** to open the 'Discover machines' blade. Under 'Are your machines virtualized?', select **Yes, with Hyper-V**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Discover machines' blade, with Hyper-V selected](Images/Exercise1/discover-machines.png)

    Read through the instructions on how to download, deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance. Close the 'Discover machines' blade (do **not** download the .VHD file, it has already been downloaded for you).
    
2.  In the global search box, enter **SmartHotelHost** into the search box, then click on the **SmartHotelHost** virtual machine.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal search box, searching for the SmartHotelHost virtual machine](Images/Exercise1/find-smarthotelhost.png)

3.  Click **Connect**, then download the RDP file and connect to the virtual machine using username **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**.
   
4.  In the SmartHotelHost RDP session, a PowerShell script will run automatically. Wait for it to complete.

    ![Screenshot of the PowerShell script that runs on first login to the SmartHotelHost](Images/Exercise1/host-ps.png)

5.  In Server Manager, click **Tools**, then **Hyper-V Manager** (if Server Manager does not open automatically, open it by clicking **Start**, then **Server Manager**). In Hyper-V manager, click **SMARTHOTELHOST**. You should now see a list of the four VMs that comprise the on-premises SmartHotel application.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager on the SmartHotelHost, showing 4 VMs: smarthotelSQL1, smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2 and UbuntuWAF](Images/Exercise1/hyperv-vm-list.png)

Before deploying the Azure Migrate appliance virtual machine, we need to create a network switch that it will use to communicate with the Hyper-V host. We could use the existing switch used by the SmartHotel VMs, but since the Azure Migrate appliance does not need to communicate with the SmartHotel VMs directly, we will protect our application environment by creating a separate switch.

6.  In Hyper-V Manager, under 'Actions', click **Virtual Switch Manager** to open the Virtual Switch Manager. The 'New virtual network switch' option should already be selected. Under 'Create virtual switch', select **Internal** as the virtual switch type, then click **Create Virtual Switch**.

    ![Screenshot of the Create Virtual Switch window from Hyper-V Manager. A new switch of type 'Internal' is selected](Images/Exercise1/create-virtual-switch-1.png)

7.  A new virtual switch is created. Change the name to **Azure Migrate Switch**, then click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Virtual Switch Manager window from Hyper-V Manager. The new switch has been renamed 'Azure Migrate Switch'](Images/Exercise1/create-virtual-switch-2.png)

We will now deploy the Azure Migrate appliance virtual machine.  Normally, you would download the .ZIP file containing the appliance to your Hyper-V host, and unzip it. To save time, these steps have been completed for you.

8.  Back in Hyper-V Manager, under 'Actions', click **Import Virtual Machine...** to open the 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard.
   
    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager, with the 'Import Virtual Machine' action highlighted](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-1.png)

9.  At the first step, 'Before You Begin', click **Next**.

10. At the 'Locate Folder' step, click **Browse** and navigate to **F:\VirtualMachines\AzureMigrateAppliance** (the folder name may also include a version number), then click **Select Folder**, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Hyper-V 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard with the F:\VirtualMachines\AzureMigrateAppliance folder selected](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-2.png)

11. At the 'Select Virtual Machine' step, the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM should already be selected. Click **Next**.

12. At the 'Choose Import Type' step, keep the default setting 'Register the virtual machine in-place'. Click **Next**.

13. At the 'Connect Network' step, you will see an error that the virtual switch previously used by the Azure Migrate appliance could not be found. From the 'Connection' drop down, select the **Azure Migrate Switch** you created earlier, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Hyper-V 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard at the 'Connect Network' step. The 'Azure Migrate Switch' has been selected.](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-4.png)

14. Review the summary page, then click **Finish** to create the Azure Migrate appliance VM.

Before starting the Azure Migrate appliance, we must configure the network settings. The existing Hyper-V environment has a NAT network using the IP address space 192.168.0.0/16. The internal NAT switch used by the SmartHotel application uses the subnet 192.168.0.0/24, and each VM in the application has been assigned a static IP address from this subnet.

You will create a new subnet 192.168.1.0/24 within the existing NAT network, with gateway address 192.168.1.1.  These steps will be completed using a PowerShell script. The Azure Migrate appliance will be assigned an IP address from this subnet using a DHCP service running on the SmartHotelHost.

15. Open Windows Explorer, and navigate to the folder **C:\OpsgilityTraining**.
    
16. Right-click on the PowerShell script **ConfigureAzureMigrateApplianceNetwork**, and select **Run with PowerShell**.

    ![Screenshot of Windows Explorer showing the 'Run with PowerShell' option for the 'ConfigureAzureMigrateApplianceNetwork' script](Images/Exercise1/run-network-script.png)

 The Azure Migrate appliance is now ready to be started.

 17. In Hyper-V Manager, click on the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM, then click **Start**.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the start button for the Azure Migrate appliance](Images/Exercise1/start-migrate-appliance.png)

### Task 3: Configure the Azure Migrate appliance

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate appliance and use it to complete the discovery phase of the migration assessment.

1.  In Hyper-V Manager, click on the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM, then click **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the connect button for the Azure Migrate appliance](Images/Exercise1/connect-appliance.png)

2.  A new window will open showing the Azure Migrate appliance. Wait for the License terms screen to show, then click **Accept**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance showing the license terms](Images/Exercise1/license-terms.png)

3.  On the 'Customize settings' screen, set the Administrator password to **demo@pass123** (twice). Then click **Finish**.

    > **NOTE:** When setting the password, the VM uses a US keyboard mapping. Use **SHIFT + 2** to enter the "@" character, and click on the 'eyeball' icon in the second password entry box to check the password that has been entered.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance showing the set Administrator password prompt](Images/Exercise1/customize-settings.png)

4.  At the 'Connect to AzureMigrateAppliance' prompt, set the appliance screen size using the slider, then click **Connect**.
   
5.  Log in with the Administrator password **demo@pass123** (remember the US keyboard mapping).
   
6.  **Wait.** After a minute or two, an Internet Explorer windows will open showing the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard. If the 'Set up Internet Explorer 11' prompt is shown, click **OK** to accept the recommended settings. If the Internet Explorer 'Content from the website listed below is being blocked...' prompt is shown, click **Close** and return to the Azure Migrate Appliance browser tab.

    ![Screenshot of the opening step of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-1.png)

7.  Under **Set up prerequisites**, accept the license terms. The following two steps to verify Internet connectivity and time synchronization should pass automatically. Click **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the first step 'Set up prerequisites' completed](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-2.png)

8.  At the next steps, 'Register with Azure Migrate', click **Login**. This opens a separate browser tab where you enter your Azure subscription credentials.
   
9.  Once you have logged in, return to the Azure Migrate Appliance tab and select your subscription and the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group using the drop-downs. Then click **Register**. After a short pause, the registration should be successful. Click **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the subscription registration step](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-4.png)

10. In the next step, 'Provide Hyper-V hosts details', enter the user name **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**. These are the credentials for the Hyper-V host. Enter **Host login** as the friendly name, then click **Save details**.

    > **NOTE:** The Azure Migrate appliance should have picked up your local keyboard mapping. Click the 'eyeball' in the password box to check the password was entered correctly.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the Hyper-V host credentials](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-5.png)


The next step is to register our Hyper-V host with the Azure Migrate appliance. In a conventional on-premises environment, the hyper-V host would be 


11. Under 'Specify the list of Hyper-V hosts and clusters to discover', click **Add**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the button to add Hyper-V hosts](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-6.png)

12. A window will appear prompting for a list of Hyper-V hosts. Enter the Hyper-V hostname, **SmartHotelHost**. Then click **Validate**.

    > **NOTE:** The Hyper-V host must be specified using a hostname, and that hostname must resolve to the IP address of the host. The Hyper-V host cannot be specified using an IP address directly.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the button to add Hyper-V hosts](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-7.png)

13. A table shows the SmartHotelHost, with status 'green'. Click **Validate** again, and check the status stays green. Then click **Save and start discovery**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the Hyper-V host has been added, with the 'Save and start discovery' button enabled](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-8.png)

14. A message 'Create Site and initiating discovery' is shown.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing a progress ticker labelled 'Creating site ant initiating discovery'](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-9.png)

15. Wait for the Azure Migrate status to show 'Created Site and initiating discovery'. This will take several minutes.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing a green check mark labelled 'Created Site and initiating discovery'](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-9b.png)


16. Return to the Azure Migrate blade in the Azure portal. (If re-opening the portal, remember to use the URL https://aka.ms/migrate/preview during the Azure Migrate preview phase.)  Click on **Servers**, make sure the **Subscription** and **Resource group** have been specified correctly. Under 'Azure Migrate: Server Assessment' you should see a count of the number of servers dicovered so far. Click **Refresh** periodically until 5 discovered servers are shown. This will take several minutes.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate portal blade. Under 'Azure Migrate: Server Assessment' the value for 'discovered servers' is '5'](Images/Exercise1/discovered-servers.png)

**Wait for the discovery process to complete before proceeding to the next Task**.

### Task 4: Create a migration assessment

In this task, you will use Azure Migrate to create a migration assessment for the SmartHotel application, using the data gathered during the discovery phase.

1.  Continuing from Task 4, click **+ Assess** to start a new migration assessment.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate portal blade, with the '+Assess' button highlighted](Images/Exercise1/start-assess.png)

2.  On the Assess servers blade, under Assessment properties, click **View all**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' blade, with the 'view all' assessment properties link highlighted](Images/Exercise1/assess-servers-1.png)

3.  The Assessment properties blade allows you to tailor many of the settings used when making a migration assessment report. Take a few moments to explore the wide range of assessment properties. Hover over the information icons to see more details on each setting. Choose any settings you like, then click **Save**.
   
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assessment properties' blade, showing a wide range of migration assessment settings](Images/Exercise1/assessment-properties.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Assess servers' page. A new server group containing servers smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2, and UbuntuWAF](Images/Exercise1/assessment-vms.png)

5.   On the 'Azure Migrate - Servers' blade, click **Refresh** periodically until the number of assessments shown is **1**. This may take several minutes.
   
    ![Screenshot from Azure Migrate showing the number of assessments as '1'](Images/Exercise1/assessments-refresh.png)
   
6.  Click on **Assessments** to see a list of assessments. Then click on the actual assessment.
   
    ![Screenshot showing a list of Azure Migrate assessments. There is only one assessment in the list. It has been highligted.](Images/Exercise1/assessment-list.png)

7.  Take a moment to study the assessment overview.

    ![Screenshot showing an Azure Migrate assessment overview for the SmartHotel application](Images/Exercise1/assessment-overview.png)

8.  Click on **Edit properties**. Note how you can now modify the assessment properties you chose earlier. Change a selection of settings, and **Save** your changes. After a few moments, the assessment report will update to reflect your changes.

9.  Click on **Azure readiness** (either the chart or the left-nav). Note that for each VM, a specific concern is listed regarding the readiness of the VM for migration.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Migrate assessment report on the VM readiness page, with the VM readiness for each VM highlighted](Images/Exercise1/readiness.png)

10. Click on **Unsupported boot type** for **smarthotelweb1**. A new browser tab opens showing Azure Migrate documentation. Search for 'Unsupported boot type' and note that the issue relates to EFI boot not being supported, and the recommendation to migrate using Azure Site Recovery, which will convert the boot type to BIOS.

    ![Screenshot of Azure documentation showing troubleshooting advice for the 'Unsupported boot type' issue. It states that EFI boot is not supported in Azure, and suggests using Azure Site Recovery for Azure migration since this will convert the boot type to BIOS](Images/Exercise1/unsupported-boot-type-doc.png)

11. Return to the portal browser tab to see details of the issue, and once again the suggested to migrate using Azure Site Recovery.

    ![Screenshot of Azure documentation showing troubleshooting advice for the 'Unsupported boot type' issue. It suggests using Azure Site Recovery for Azure migration since this will convert the boot type to BIOS](Images/Exercise1/unsupported-boot-type-portal.png)

12. Take a few minutes to explore other aspects of the migration assessment. Check why the UbuntuWAF is marked as 'conditionally ready for Azure', and explore the costs associated with the migration.

### Task 5: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1.  Return to the Azure Migrate blade in the Azure Portal, and click **Discovered Items**. Note that each VM has their 'Dependencies' status as 'Requires agent installation'. Click on **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the discovered VMs in Azure Migrate. Each VM has dependency status 'Requires agent installation'](Images/Exercise1/discovered-items.png)

2.  On the Dependencies blade, click **Configure OMS workspace**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, with the 'Configure OMS Workspace' button highlighted](Images/Exercise1/configure-oms-link.png)

3.  Create a new OMS workspace. Use **AzureMigrateWorkspace<\unique number\>** as the workspace name, where \<unique number\> is a random number. Choose **East US** as the workspace location (Azure Migrate v2 private preview only supports the US geography). Click **Configure**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Configure OMS workspace' blade](Images/Exercise1/configure-oms-link.png)

4.  Wait for the workspace to be deployed. Once it is deployed, make a note of the **Workspace ID** and **Workspace key** (for example by using Notepad).

    ![Screenshot of part of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, showing the OMS workspace ID and key](Images/Exercise1/workspace-id-key.png)

5.  Right-click and copy the links for each of the 4 agent installers (the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and the Dependency Agent, for both Windows and Linux). Make a note of each of the links.

    ![Screenshot of part of the Azure Migrate 'Dependencies' blade, showing the agent download links](Images/Exercise1/agent-links.png)

6.  Return to the RDP session with the **SmartHotelHost**. In **Hyper-V Manager**, click on **smarthotelweb1** and click **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot from Hyper-V manager highlighting the 'Connect' button for the smarthotelweb1 VM](Images/Exercise1/connect-web1.png)

7.  Log in to the **Administrator** account using the password **demo@pass123**.

8.  Open **Internet Explorer**, and paste the link for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent Windows installer into the address bar. **Run** the installer.

    ![Screenshot showing the Internet Explorer prompt to run the installer for the Microsoft Monitoring Agent](Images/Exercise1/mma-win-run.png)

9.  Click through the installation wizard. On the **Agent Setup Options** page, select **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**. Enter your Workspace ID and Workspace Key on the next page, and select **Azure Commercial** from the Azure Cloud drop-down. Click through the remaining pages and install the agent.

    ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent install wizard, showing the Log Analytics (OMS) workspace ID and key](Images/Exercise1/mma-wizard.png)

10. Paste the link to the Dependency Agent Windows installer into the browser address bar. **Run** the installer and click through the install wizard to complete the installation.

    ![Screenshot showing the Internet Explorer prompt to run the installer for the Dependency Agent](Images/Exercise1/da-win-run.png)

11. Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.  Connect to the **smarthotelweb2** VM and repeat the installation process for both agents (the administrator password is the same as for smarthotelweb1).

You will now deploy the Linux versions of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the UbuntuWAF VM. To do so, you will first connect to the UbuntuWAF remotely using an SSH session to the IP address of the SmartHotelHost. The SmartHotelHost has a NAT rule which forwards SSH connections to the UbuntuWAF VM.

12. In the Azure portal, navigate to the SmartHotelHost VM and note the public IP address. Open a new browser tab and navigate to **https://shell.azure.com**, accept and prompts and open a **Bash shell** session (not a PowerShell session).

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell, with a Bash session](Images/Exercise1/cloud-shell.png)

13. Enter the following command, replacing \<ip address\> with the public IP address of the SmartHotelHost.

    ```
    ssh demouser@<ip address>
    ```

15. Enter 'yes' if prompted whether to connect. Use the password **demo@pass123**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell, with a SSH session to UbuntuWAF](Images/Exercise1/ssh.png)

16. Enter the following command, followed by the password **demo@pass123** when prompted.
    ```
    sudo -s
    ```
    This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

17. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Workspace Key\> with the values copied previously.
    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Workspace Key>
    ```
    
18. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied previously.
    ```
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

19. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.
    ```
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

20. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.
    ```
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```
    ![Screenshot showing that the Dependency Agent install on Linux was successful](Images/Exercise1/da-linux-done.png)

21. Generate some traffic on the SmartHotel application, so the dependency visualization has some data to work with. Browse to the public IP address of the SmartHotelHost, and spend a few minutes refreshing the page and checking guests in and out.

### Task 6: Explore dependency visualization

In this task, you will explore the dependency visualization that was created based on the data gathered by the dependency agent installed in Task 5.

1.  Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **Discovered items** blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as 'View dependencies'. (If not, wait a few minutes and refresh your browser.)

    ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies links in the Azure Migrate discovered items blade](Images/Exercise1/view-dependencies.png)

2.  Click on **View dependencies** for **smarthotelweb1**.

3.  Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Click on a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.

    ![Screenshot showing the dependencies visualization in Azure Migrate](Images/Exercise1/dependencies.png)

4.  Use **CTRL + click** to multi-select several machines from the dependency visualization. Then click **+ Group machines**, enter a group name, and click **OK**. Note how the dependency visualization can be used to create machine groups for later migration assessment.

    ![Screenshot showing the click path to multi-select a group of machines in the dependency visualization and create an Azure Migrate group](Images/Exercise1/dependency-group.png)


## Exercise 2: Migrate the Application Database

### Overview

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise you will migrate the application database from the on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine to a new database hosted in the Azure SQL Database service. You will use the Azure Database Migration Service to complete the migration, which uses the SQL Server Data Migration Assistant for the database assessment and schema migration phases.

### Task 1: Register the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider

Prior to using the Azure Database Migration Service, the resource provider **Microsoft.DataMigration** must be registered in the target subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, select **All services**, and then select **Subscriptions**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure portal click path to the 'Subscriptions' service](Images/Exercise2/subscriptions.png)

2. Select the subscription in which you want to create the instance of the Azure Database Migration Service. You may need to un-check the global subscription filter to see all your subscriptions.

    ![Screenshot showing a subscription being selected from the subscriptions list](Images/Exercise2/choose-subscription.png)

3. In the subscription blade, select **Resource providers**. Search for **migration** and select **Microsoft.DataMigration**. If the resource provider status is unregistered, click **Register**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider and 'Register' button](Images/Exercise2/register-rp.png)

    > **Note**: It may take several minutes for the resource provider to register. You can proceed to the next task without waiting for the registration to complete. We will not use the resource provider until task 5.

    ![Screenshot showing the resource provider 'registered' status](Images/Exercise2/registered-rp.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you registered the **Microsoft.DataMigration** resource provider with your subscription. This enables this subscription to use the Azure Database Migration Service.

### Task 4: Prepare On-premises Virtual Machines

In this task you will install the Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) on your on-premises servers prior to migration. 

> **Note:** The Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. The VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM Extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VM, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure VM Agent, VM extensions cannot be used.
>
> We will install the VM agent on the Hyper-V VMs before they are migrated. You can also install the agent after migration.

1.  Using the Azure portal, navigate to the **SmartHotelHost** VM, then click **Connect** and open an RDP session to the VM using the user name **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**.

2.  Open **Hyper-V Manager**, either from the Start menu or by opening Server Manager and using the 'tools' menu.

4.  Open a web browser and download the VM Agent from:

    ```
    https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789
    ```

5.  After the installer has downloaded, run it. Click **Next**, **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then **Next** again. Click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Windows installer for the Azure VM Agent](Images/Exercise3/vm-agent-win.png)

6.  Close the smarthotelweb1 window. Repeat the Azure VM agent installation process on **SmartHotelWeb2**.

> Note: There is no need to install the Azure VM agent on the **smarthotelSQL1** VM, since the SmartHotel database has been migrated to the Azure SQL Database managed service.

We will now install the Linux version of the Azure VM Agent on the Ubuntu VM. All Linux distributions supports by Azure have integrated the Azure VM Agent into their software repositories, making installation easy in most cases.

7.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the SmartHotelHost VM and note the public IP address. Open a new browser tab and navigate to **https://shell.azure.com**, accept and prompts and open a **Bash shell** session (not a PowerShell session).

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell, with a Bash session](Images/Exercise1/cloud-shell.png)

8.  Enter the following command, replacing \<ip address\> with the public IP address of the SmartHotelHost.

    ```
    ssh demouser@<ip address>
    ```

9. Enter 'yes' if prompted whether to connect. Use the password **demo@pass123**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell, with a SSH session to UbuntuWAF](Images/Exercise1/ssh.png)

    ![Screenshot highlighting the recovery plan 'Save' button](Images/Exercise3/recovery-plan-save.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you created a recovery plan to control the start order of your virtual machines on failover.

### Task 7: Configure Azure VM settings

By default, Azure Site Recovery uses unmanaged disks when creating VMs in Azure. This is because when using Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery, fail-back to on-premises environments is only support with unmanaged disks. For migration, fail-back is not a concern and so using managed disks is preferable.

In this task, you will change the replication settings for each Azure VM to use Managed Disks. You will also configure the internal IP address used by each VM, and review the VM size.

1.  Navigate to the Recovery Service Vault blade for your vault, then click **Replicated items**. Click on the **UbuntuWAF** VM to open the replication settings for this VM. 

    ![Screenshot showing the replicated items in ASR, listing 3 VMs](Images/Exercise3/replicated-items.png)

2.  Click **Compute and Network**, then click **Edit**.

    ![Screenshot showing the click path to edit the replication settings for a VM](Images/Exercise3/compute-and-network-edit.png)

3.  Change the **Use managed disks** setting to **Yes**. Review the VM size is **F2s_v2 (2 cores, 4GB memory, 1 NICs)**, and if necessary, change it.
   
    > **Note:**  You can also use this blade to change other settings, such as the availability set.

    ![Screenshot showing a VM being configured to replicate using managed disks](Images/Exercise3/managed-disks.png)

4.  Under **Network Interfaces**, click on **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network Interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM](Images/Exercise3/nic.png)

5.  Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.8**.

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR](Images/Exercise3/private-ip.png)

6.  Click **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the UbuntuWAF settings.

6.  Repeat these steps to configure managed disks for the other VMs.
    - For **smarthotelweb1** use private IP address **192.168.0.4**.
    - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**.

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you modified the replication settings for each VM to use managed disks in Azure, and configured their private IP addresses to match their on-premises IP addresses.

> **Note:** Azure Site Recovery made a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the size and settings of migrated items. Setting the private IP address helps us ensure our virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 8: Test Failover

In this task you will perform a test failover of the SmartHotelWeb* virtual machines and configure the machines to point to the previously migrated Azure SQL Database.

1. Click **Replicated items** under **Protected items** to view the status of replication for your virtual machines. Verify they have a status of **Protected**. 

    ![Screenshot showing protection status for replicated VMs in ASR](Images/Exercise3/protected.png)

    > **Note**: If the virtual machines are still synchronizing, wait for replication to finish before moving on to the next step.

6. Click on **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** and select the **SmartHotelRecovery** plan. Click **Test failover**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the 'Test failover' button in ASR](Images/Exercise3/test-failover.png)

7. In the **Test failover** blade, change **Recovery point** to **Latest (lowest RPO)** and select the **Azure virtual network** **SmartHotelASRVNet**. Click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot showing ASR test failover settings](Images/Exercise3/recovery-point.png)

8. Click the notification for **Test failover of 'SmartHotelRecovery' is in progress** to view the status of the failover.

    ![Screenshot showing notificaiton that test failover is in progress](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-notification.png)

    ![Screenshot showing test failover status](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-progress.png)

   **Wait for the test failover to complete before continuing to the next task.**

   > **Note**: The test failover can take up to 30 minutes to complete for all machines.

9. Navigate to the **SmartHotelASRRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

   > **Note:** Because this is a test failover, the virtual machine names have had the suffix **-test** appended.

   ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces)](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-resources.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you used Azure Site Recovery to perform a test failover. This migrated your on-premises VMs to Azure.

### Task 9: Configure database connection

The application tier VM **smarthotelweb2** is configured to connect to the application database running on the **smarthotelsql** VM. 

On the migrated VM **smarthotelweb2-test**, this configuration needs to be updated to use the Azure SQL Database.

As a preliminary step, you will temporarily associate a public IP address with the **smarthotelweb2** VM, so that you can connect to it using Remote Desktop. (Alternatively, your could connect via a separate 'jumppbox' VM or via a Site-to-Site or ExpressRoute connection.)

> **Note:** You do not need to update any configuration files on **smarthotelweb1-test** or the **UbuntuWAF-test** VMs, since the migration has preserved the private IP addresses of all virtual machines they connect with.

1.  Click **+ Create a resource** and enter **Public IP Address** in the search box. In the **Public IP Address** blade click **Create**.

    ![Screnshot showing the Public IP address create option](Images/Exercise3/public-ip-create-1.png)

2.  Create a new public IP address with the following values (plus defaults) and click **Create**.

    - Name: **smarthotel-ip**
    - Resource group: **SmartHotelASRRG**
    - Location: **Select the same location as the smarthotelweb2-test VM**

    ![Scnreeshot showing the 'Connect' button for VM 'smarthotelweb2-test'](Images/Exercise3/web2-connect.png)

7.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **C:\inetpub\SmartHotel.Registration.Wcf** folder. Double-click the **Web.config** file and open with Notepad.

8.  Update the **DefaultConnection** setting to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

    You can find the connection string for the Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal by browsing to the database, and clicking **Show database connection strings**

     ![Screenshot showing the 'Show database connection strings' link for an Azure SQL Database](Images/Exercise3/show-connection-strings.png)

    Copy the connection string, and paste into the web.config file on **smarthotelweb2-test**, replacing the existing connection string.
    
    Make the following changes to the connection string:
    - Set the User ID to **demouser**.
    - Set the Password to **demo@pass123**.
    - Append the following text to the end of the connection string (immediately before the closing quotes): **" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient**

    ![Screenshot showing the user ID and Password in the web.config database connection string](Images/Exercise3/db-user-pass.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task, you updated the **smarthotelweb2-test** configuration to connect to the Azure SQL Database.

### Task 10: Configure public IP and test application

In this task, you will associate the public IP address with the UbuntuWAF VM. This will allow you to verify that the SmartHotel application is running in Azure.

1.  Using similar steps, associate the public IP address resource **smarthotel-ip** with the network interface of the **UbuntuWAF-test** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the public IP being enabled for the UbuntuWAF network interface](Images/Exercise3/ubuntu-public-ip-set.png)

2.  Return to the **UbuntuWAF-test** VM overview blade and copy the **Public IP address** value.

    ![Screenshot showing the IP address for the UbuntuWAF VM](Images/Exercise3/ubuntu-public-ip.png)

3.  Open a new browser tab and paste the IP address. Verify that the SmartHotel360 application is available in Azure.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel application](Images/Exercise3/smarthotel.png)

    > **Note**: If you see the default IIS web application, the default site started before SmartHotel.Registration. RDP to the **smarthotelweb1-test** server (you will need to add a public IP address first), open IIS Manager, stop the default site and start the SmartHotel.Registration site.

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you configured the public IP address for the SmartHotel application and verified that the migrated site is working.

# Azure Migration hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to assess and migrate a multi-tier application from Hyper-V to Azure. You will learn the various Azure tools available for different steps of the migration, and walk through using each of those tools.

After this hands-on lab, you will know the role of each of the migration tools and how to use them to successfully migrate an on-premises multi-tier application to Azure.

## Overview

Before the lab, you will have pre-deployed an on-premises infrastructure hosted in Hyper-V.  This infrastructure is hosting a multi-tier application called 'SmartHotel', using Hyper-V VMs for each of the application tiers.

During the lab, you will migrate this entire application stack to Azure. This will include assessing the on-premises application using Azure Migrate; migrating the database tier to Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Data Migration Assistant (DMA) and the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS); and migrating the web and application tiers using Azure Site Recovery. This includes migration of both Windows and Linux VMs.


## Solution architecture

The SmartHotel application comprises 4 VMs hosted in Hyper-V:
- **Database tier** Hosted on the smarthotelSQL1 VM, which is running Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017
- **Application tier** Hosted on the smarthotelweb2 VM, which is running Windows Server 2012R2.
- **Web tier** Hosted on the smarthotelweb1 VM, which is running Windows Server 2012R2.
- **Web proxy** Hosted on the  UbuntuWAF VM, which is running Nginx on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

(For simplicity, there is no redundancy in any of the tiers.)

**Note:** For convenience, the Hyper-V host itself is deployed as an Azure VM. For the purposes of the lab, you should think of it as an on-premises machine.

TODO ADD PICTURE

To assess the Hyper-V environment, you will use Azure Migrate. This includes deploying the Azure Migrate appliance on the Hyper-V host to gather information about the environment. For deeper analysis, the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent will be installed on the VMs, enabling the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

The SQL Server database will be assessed by installing the Microsoft SQL Server Data Migration Assistant (DMA) on the Hyper-V host, and using it to gather information about the database. The DMA will also be used to migrate the database schema to Azure SQL Database. Data migration will then be completed using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).

The application, web, and web proxy tiers will be migrated to Azure VMs using Azure Site Recovery (ASR). This includes deploying the ASR collector appliance into the Hyper-V environment, building the Azure environment, replicating data to Azure, and performing a failover to migrate the application to Azure.

**Note:** After migration, the application could be modernized to use Azure Application Gateway instead of the Ubuntu Nginx VM, and to use Azure App Service to host both the web tier and application tier. These optimizations are out of scope of this lab, which is focused only on a 'lift and shift' migration to Azure VMs.

## Requirements

1.  You will need Owner or Contributor permissions for an Azure subscription to use in the lab.

2.  Your subscription must have sufficient unused quota to deploy the VMs used in this lab.

3.  Your subscription must be registered for the Azure Migrate v2 Preview.

For further details, see [Before the HOL - Azure Migration](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Azure%20Migration.md).

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the [Before the HOL - Azure Migration](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Azure%20Migration.md) setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

**Allow at least 60 minutes to deploy the on-premises environment before you start the lab.**

## Exercise 1: Discover and assess the on-premises environment

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Azure Migrate to assess the on-premises environment.

### Task 1: Create the Azure Migrate project

In this task, you will create the Azure Migrate project and select the migration assessment tool.

1.  Open your browser and navigate to http://aka.ms/migrate/preview. This special link is used during the Azure Migrate v2 preview phase to access the Azure Portal with the Azure Migrate v2 service enabled.

2.  Click **All services**, then search for and select  **Azure Migrate** to open the Azure Migrate Overview blade, shown below.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate overview blade](Images/Exercise1/azure-migrate-overview.png)

3.  Click the **Add tool(s)** button to open the 'Add a tool' wizard at the 'Migrate project' step.  Select your subscription and create a new resource group named **AzureMigrateRG**. Choose a geography close to you to store the migration assessment data (Note: options may be limited during the preview phase).

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Migrate project' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-1.png)

    Click **Next**.

4.  At the 'Select assessment tool' step, select **Azure Migrate: Server Assessment**, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Select assessment tool' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-2.png)

5.  At the 'Select migration tool' step, check the **Skip adding a migration tool for now** checkbox, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Select migration tool' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-3.png)

6.  At the 'Review + add tool(s)' step, review the settings and click **Add tool(s)**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Add a tool' wizard, at the 'Review + Add tool(s)' step](Images/Exercise1/add-tool-4.png)

7.  The Azure Migrate deployment will start. Once it has completed, click on the **Servers** panel of the Azure Migrate blade. Select your subscription and the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group from the drop-downs. You should now see 'Azure Migrate: Server Assessment', as shown below.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Servers' blade, showing the Azure Migrate: Server Assessment tool for the selected subscription and resource group](Images/Exercise1/servers.png)

### Task 2: Deploy the Azure Migrate appliance

In this task, you will deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs.

1.  Click **Discover** to open the 'Discover machines' blade. Under 'Are your machines virtualized?', select **Yes, with Hyper-V**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Discover machines' blade, with Hyper-V selected](Images/Exercise1/discover-machines.png)

    Read through the instructions on how to download, deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance. Close the 'Discover machines' blade (do **not** download the .VHD file, it has already been downloaded for you).
    
2.  In the top ribbon, enter **SmartHotelHost** into the search box, then click on the **SmartHotelHost** virtual machine.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal search box, searching for the SmartHotelHost virtual machine](Images/Exercise1/find-smarthotelhost.png)

3.  Click **Connect**, then download the RDP file and connect to the virtual machine using username **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**.
   
4.  In the SmartHotelHost RDP session, if Server Manager does not open automatically, open it by clicking **Start**, then **Server Manager**.

5.  In Server Manager, click **Tools**, then **Hyper-V Manager**. In Hyper-V manager, click **SMARTHOTELHOST**. You should now see a list of the four VMs that comprise the on-premises SmartHotel application.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager on the SmartHotelHost, showing 4 VMs: smarthotelSQL1, smarthotelweb1, smarthotelweb2 and UbuntuWAF](Images/Exercise1/hyperv-vm-list.png)


Before deploying the Azure Migrate appliance virtual machine, we need to create a network switch that it will use to communicate with the Hyper-V host. We could use the existing switch used by the SmartHotel VMs, but since the Azure Migrate appliance does not need to communicate with the SmartHotel VMs directly, we will protect our application environment by creating a separate switch.

6.  In Hyper-V Manager, under 'Actions', click **Virtual Switch Manager** to open the Virtual Switch Manager. The 'New virtual network switch' option should already be selected. Under 'Create virtual switch', select **Internal** as the virtual switch type, then click **Create Virtual Switch**.

    ![Screenshot of the Create Virtual Switch window from Hyper-V Manager. A new switch of type 'Internal' is selected](Images/Exercise1/create-virtual-switch-1.png)

7.  A new virtual switch is created. Change the name to **Azure Migrate Switch**, then click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Virtual Switch Manager window from Hyper-V Manager. The new switch has been renamed 'Azure Migrate Switch'](Images/Exercise1/create-virtual-switch-2.png)

We will now deploy the Azure Migrate appliance virtual machine.  Normally, you would download the .ZIP file containing the appliance to your Hyper-V host, and unzip it. To save time, these steps have been completed for you.

8.  Back in Hyper-V Manager, under 'Actions', click **Import Virtual Machine...** to open the 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard.
   
    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager, with the 'Import Virtual Machine' action highlighted](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-1.png)

9.  At the first step, 'Before You Begin', click **Next**.

10. At the 'Locate Folder' step, click **Browse** and navigate to **F:\VirtualMachines\AzureMigrateAppliance**, then click **Select Folder**, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Hyper-V 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard with the F:\VirtualMachines\AzureMigrateAppliance folder selected](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-2.png)

11. At the 'Select Virtual Machine' step, the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM should already be selected. Click **Next**.

12. At the 'Choose Import Type' step, keep the default setting 'Register the virtual machine in-place'. Click **Next**.

13. At the 'Connect Network' step, you will see an error that the virtual switch previously used by the Azure Migrate appliance could not be found. From the 'Connection' drop down, select the **Azure Migrate Switch** you created earlier, then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Hyper-V 'Import Virtual Machine' wizard at the 'Connect Network' step. The 'Azure Migrate Switch' has been selected.](Images/Exercise1/import-vm-4.png)

14. Review the summary page, then click **Finish** to create the Azure Migrate appliance VM.

Before starting the Azure Migrate appliance, we must configure the network settings. The existing Hyper-V environment has a NAT network using the IP address space 192.168.0.0/16. The internal NAT switch used by the SmartHotel application uses the subnet 192.168.0.0/24, and each VM in the application has been assigned a static IP address from this subnet.

You will create a new subnet 192.168.1.0/24 within the existing NAT network, with gateway address 192.168.1.1. The Azure Migrate appliance VM will be assigned IP address 192.168.1.4.  These steps will be completed using a PowerShell script.

15. Open Windows Explorer, and navigate to the folder **C:\OpsgilityTraining**.
    
16. Right-click on the PowerShell script **ConfigureAzureMigrateApplianceNetwork**, and select **Run with PowerShell**.

    ![Screenshot of Windows Explorer showing the 'Run with PowerShell' option for the 'ConfigureAzureMigrateApplianceNetwork' script](Images/Exercise1/run-network-script.png)

 The Azure Migrate appliance is now ready to be started.

 17. In Hyper-V Manager, click on the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM, then click **Start**.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the start button for the Azure Migrate appliance](Images/Exercise1/start-migrate-appliance.png)

### Task 3: Configure the Azure Migrate appliance

1.  In Hyper-V Manager, click on the **AzureMigrateAppliance** VM, then click **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the connect button for the Azure Migrate appliance](Images/Exercise1/connect-appliance.png)

2.  A new window will open showing the Azure Migrate appliance. Wait for the License terms screen to show, then click **Accept**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance showing the license terms](Images/Exercise1/license-terms.png)

3.  On the 'Customize settings' screen, set the Administrator password to **demo@pass123** (twice). Then click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance showing the set Administrator password prompt](Images/Exercise1/customize-settings.png)

4.  At the 'Connect to AzureMigrateAppliance' prompt, set the appliance screen size using the slider, then click **Connect**.
   
    ![Screenshot of the screen size prompt when connecting to the Azure Migrate appliance](Images/Exercise1/screen-size.png)

5.  Log in with the Administrator password **demo@pass123**.
   
6.  **Wait.** After a minute or two, an Internet Explorer windows will open showing the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard. If the 'Set up Internet Explorer 11' prompt is shown, click **OK** to accept the recommended settings. If the Internet Explorer 'Content from the website listed below is being blocked...' prompt is shown, click **Close** and return to the Azure Migrate Appliance browser tab.

    ![Screenshot of the opening step of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-1.png)

7.  Under **Set up prerequisites**, accept the license terms. The following two steps to verify Internet connectivity and time synchronization should pass automatically. Click **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the first step 'Set up prerequisites' completed](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-2.png)

8.  At the next steps, 'Register with Azure Migrate', click **Login**. This opens a separate browser tab where you enter your Azure subscription credentials.
   
9.  Once you have logged in, return to the Azure Migrate Appliance tab and select your subscription and the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group using the drop-downs. Then click **Register**. After a short pause, the registration should be successful. Click **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the subscription registration step](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-4.png)

10. In the next step, 'Provide Hyper-V hosts details', enter the user name **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**. These are the credentials for the Hyper-V host. Enter **Host login** as the friendly name, then click **Save details**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the Hyper-V host credentials](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-5.png)

11. Under 'Specify the list of Hyper-V hosts and clusters to discover', click **Add**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the button to add Hyper-V hosts](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-6.png)

12. A window will appear prompting for a list of Hyper-V hosts. Enter the Hyper-V host IP address, **10.0.0.4**. Then click **Validate**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the button to add Hyper-V hosts](Images/Exercise1/appliance-config-7.png)

**Wait for the discovery process to complete before proceeding to the next Task (about 15 minutes)**.

### Task 3: Create a migration assessment

***BLOCKED AT THIS POINT - RAISED WITH AZURE MIGRATE PM***




## Exercise 2: Migrate the Application Database

### Overview

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise you will migrate the application database from the on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine to a new database hosted in the Azure SQL Database service. You will use the Azure Database Migration Service to complete the migration, which uses the SQL Server Data Migration Assistant for the database assessment and schema migration phases.

### Task 1: Create an Azure SQL Database

In this task you will create a new Azure SQL database to migrate the on-premises database to. You will also configure network access to the SQL database from the Hyper-V host that is running the SmartHotel application on-premises.

1.  Open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and log in using your subscription credentials.

2.  Click **+ Create a resource**, then click **Databases**, then click **SQL Database**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the click path to create a SQL Database](Images/Exercise2/new-sql-db.png)

3.  The **Create SQL Database** blade opens, showing the 'Basics' tab. Complete the form as follows:

    - Subscription: **Select your subscription**
    - Resource group (create new): **SmartHotelDBRG**
    - Database name: **smarthoteldb**
    - Server: Click **Create new** and fill in the New server blade as follows:
        - Server name: **smarthoteldb\[add unique number\]**
        - Server admin login: **demouser**
        - Password: **demo@pass123**
        - Location: **IMPORTANT: Select the same region you used when you started your lab - this makes migration faster**

        >  **Note**: You can verify the location by opening another browser tab, navigating to https://portal.azure.com and clicking Virtual Machines on the left navigation. Use the same region as the **SmartHotelHost** virtual machine.

    ![Screenshot from the Azure portal showing the Create SQL Database blade](Images/Exercise2/new-db.png)

    ![Screenshot from the Azure portal showing the New server blade (when creating a SQL database)](Images/Exercise2/new-db-server.png)

4.  Click **Review + Create**, then click **Create** to create the database. Wait for the deployment to complete.
 
> Note: During migration, the existing database schema will be transferred to the Azure SQL Database using the SQL Server Database Migration Assistant (DMA). We will run this on the Hyper-V host. We therefore need to grant access from the Hyper-V host to the Azure SQL server hosting the Azure SQL database.

5.  Browse to the Hyper-V host by searching for **smarthotelhost** in the global search and clicking on the result for the virtual machine.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotelHost VM located using the Azure global search field](Images/Exercise2/search-host.png)

6.  Take a note of the public IP address of the SmartHotelHost VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotelHost VM blade, with the public IP address highlighted](Images/Exercise2/host-ip.png)

7.  Browse to the SQL Server by searching for **smarthoteldb** in the global search and clicking the result for the SQL server (**not** the SQL database).

    ![Screenshot showing the smarthoteldb6 SQL server located using the Azure global search field](Images/Exercise2/search-sql.png)

8.  Click **Show firewall settings** to open the SQL server 'Firewalls and virtual networks' blade.

    ![Screenshot from the Azure portal blade for the SQL server, with the 'Show firewall settings' link highlighted](Images/Exercise2/show-firewall-settings.png)

9.  Create a new rule, specifying the rule name **Hyper-V host** and the SmartHotelHost VM public IP address noted earlier as both the 'Start IP' and 'End IP'. Click **Save**. When the save operation completes, click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot from the SQL server firewall settings blade, with the 'Add client IP' and 'Save' buttons highlighted](Images/Exercise2/add-host-ip.png)


#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

### Task 4: Prepare On-premises Virtual Machines

In this task you will install the Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) on your on-premises servers prior to migration. 

> **Note:** The Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. The VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM Extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VM, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure VM Agent, VM extensions cannot be used.
>
> We will install the VM agent on the Hyper-V VMs before they are migrated. You can also install the agent after migration.

1.  Using the Azure portal, navigate to the **SmartHotelHost** VM, then click **Connect** and open an RDP session to the VM using the user name **demouser** and password **demo@pass123**.

2.  Open **Hyper-V Manager**, either from the Start menu or by opening Server Manager and using the 'tools' menu.

3.  In Hyper-V Manager, click on **SmartHotelWeb1**, then click **Connect**. This opens a new session with the SmartHotelWeb1 VM. Log in to the Administrator account using password **demo@pass123**.

4.  Open a web browser and download the VM Agent from:

    ```
    https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789
    ```

5.  After the installer has downloaded, run it. Click **Next**, **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then **Next** again. Click **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Windows installer for the Azure VM Agent](Images/Exercise3/vm-agent-win.png)

6.  Close the smarthotelweb1 window. Repeat the Azure VM agent installation process on **SmartHotelWeb2**.

> Note: There is no need to install the Azure VM agent on the **smarthotelSQL1** VM, since the SmartHotel database has been migrated to the Azure SQL Database managed service.

We will now install the Linux version of the Azure VM Agent on the Ubuntu VM. All Linux distributions supports by Azure have integrated the Azure VM Agent into their software repositories, making installation easy in most cases.

7.  In Hyper-V Manager, click on **UbuntuWAF**, then click **Connect...**. This opens a new session with the VM.
   
8.  If prompted, log in to the existing **demouser** account, using password **demo@pass123**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the recovery plan 'Save' button](Images/Exercise3/recovery-plan-save.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you created a recovery plan to control the start order of your virtual machines on failover.

### Task 7: Configure Azure VM settings

By default, Azure Site Recovery uses unmanaged disks when creating VMs in Azure. This is because when using Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery, fail-back to on-premises environments is only support with unmanaged disks. For migration, fail-back is not a concern and so using managed disks is preferable.

In this task, you will change the replication settings for each Azure VM to use Managed Disks. You will also configure the internal IP address used by each VM, and review the VM size.

1.  Navigate to the Recovery Service Vault blade for your vault, then click **Replicated items**. Click on the **UbuntuWAF** VM to open the replication settings for this VM. 

    ![Screenshot showing the replicated items in ASR, listing 3 VMs](Images/Exercise3/replicated-items.png)

2.  Click **Compute and Network**, then click **Edit**.

    ![Screenshot showing the click path to edit the replication settings for a VM](Images/Exercise3/compute-and-network-edit.png)

3.  Change the **Use managed disks** setting to **Yes**. Review the VM size is **F2s_v2 (2 cores, 4GB memory, 1 NICs)**, and if necessary, change it.
   
    > **Note:**  You can also use this blade to change other settings, such as the availability set.

    ![Screenshot showing a VM being configured to replicate using managed disks](Images/Exercise3/managed-disks.png)

4.  Under **Network Interfaces**, click on **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network Interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM](Images/Exercise3/nic.png)

5.  Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.8**.

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR](Images/Exercise3/private-ip.png)

6.  Click **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the UbuntuWAF settings.

6.  Repeat these steps to configure managed disks for the other VMs.
    - For **smarthotelweb1** use private IP address **192.168.0.4**.
    - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**.

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you modified the replication settings for each VM to use managed disks in Azure, and configured their private IP addresses to match their on-premises IP addresses.

> **Note:** Azure Site Recovery made a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the size and settings of migrated items. Setting the private IP address helps us ensure our virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 8: Test Failover

In this task you will perform a test failover of the SmartHotelWeb* virtual machines and configure the machines to point to the previously migrated Azure SQL Database.

1. Click **Replicated items** under **Protected items** to view the status of replication for your virtual machines. Verify they have a status of **Protected**. 

    ![Screenshot showing protection status for replicated VMs in ASR](Images/Exercise3/protected.png)

    > **Note**: If the virtual machines are still synchronizing, wait for replication to finish before moving on to the next step.

6. Click on **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** and select the **SmartHotelRecovery** plan. Click **Test failover**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the 'Test failover' button in ASR](Images/Exercise3/test-failover.png)

7. In the **Test failover** blade, change **Recovery point** to **Latest (lowest RPO)** and select the **Azure virtual network** **SmartHotelASRVNet**. Click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot showing ASR test failover settings](Images/Exercise3/recovery-point.png)

8. Click the notification for **Test failover of 'SmartHotelRecovery' is in progress** to view the status of the failover.

    ![Screenshot showing notificaiton that test failover is in progress](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-notification.png)

    ![Screenshot showing test failover status](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-progress.png)

   **Wait for the test failover to complete before continuing to the next task.**

   > **Note**: The test failover can take up to 30 minutes to complete for all machines.

9. Navigate to the **SmartHotelASRRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

   > **Note:** Because this is a test failover, the virtual machine names have had the suffix **-test** appended.

   ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces)](Images/Exercise3/test-failover-resources.png)

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you used Azure Site Recovery to perform a test failover. This migrated your on-premises VMs to Azure.

### Task 9: Configure database connection

The application tier VM **smarthotelweb2** is configured to connect to the application database running on the **smarthotelsql** VM. 

On the migrated VM **smarthotelweb2-test**, this configuration needs to be updated to use the Azure SQL Database.

As a preliminary step, you will temporarily associate a public IP address with the **smarthotelweb2** VM, so that you can connect to it using Remote Desktop. (Alternatively, your could connect via a separate 'jumppbox' VM or via a Site-to-Site or ExpressRoute connection.)

> **Note:** You do not need to update any configuration files on **smarthotelweb1-test** or the **UbuntuWAF-test** VMs, since the migration has preserved the private IP addresses of all virtual machines they connect with.

1.  Click **+ Create a resource** and enter **Public IP Address** in the search box. In the **Public IP Address** blade click **Create**.

2.  Create a new public IP address with the following values (plus defaults) and click **Create**.

    - Name: **smarthotel-ip**
    - Resource group: **SmartHotelASRRG**
    - Location: **Select the same location as the smarthotelweb2-test VM**

6.  Return to the **SmartHotelWeb2-test** VM overview blade, and click **Connect**. Download the RDP file and connect to the machine with the username **Administrator** and the password **demo@pass123**.

    ![Scnreeshot showing the 'Connect' button for VM 'smarthotelweb2-test'](Images/Exercise3/web2-connect.png)

7.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **C:\inetpub\SmartHotel.Registration.Wcf** folder. Double-click the **Web.config** file and open with Notepad.

8.  Update the **DefaultConnection** setting to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

    You can find the connection string for the Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal by browsing to the database, and clicking **Show database connection strings**

     ![Screenshot showing the 'Show database connection strings' link for an Azure SQL Database](Images/Exercise3/show-connection-strings.png)

    Copy the connection string, and paste into the web.config file on **smarthotelweb2-test**, replacing the existing connection string.
    
    Make the following changes to the connection string:
    - Set the User ID to **demouser**.
    - Set the Password to **demo@pass123**.
    - Append the following text to the end of the connection string (immediately before the closing quotes): **" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient**

    ![Screenshot showing the providerName in the web.config database connection string](Images/Exercise3/db-provider-name.png)

9.  Save the web.config file and exit your RDP session.

10. Browse to **SmartHotelWeb2-test**, click **Networking**, and then click the name of the **Network interface** associated with the virtual machine.

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task, you updated the **smarthotelweb2-test** configuration to connect to the Azure SQL Database.

### Task 10: Configure public IP and test application

In this task, you will associate the public IP address with the UbuntuWAF VM. This will allow you to verify that the SmartHotel application is running in Azure.

1.  Using similar steps, associate the public IP address resource **smarthotel-ip** with the network interface of the **UbuntuWAF-test** VM.

    ![Screenshot showing the public IP being enabled for the UbuntuWAF network interface](Images/Exercise3/ubuntu-public-ip-set.png)

2.  Return to the **UbuntuWAF-test** VM overview blade and copy the **Public IP address** value.

    ![Screenshot showing the IP address for the UbuntuWAF VM](Images/Exercise3/ubuntu-public-ip.png)

3.  Open a new browser tab and paste the IP address. Verify that the SmartHotel360 application is available in Azure.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel application](Images/Exercise3/smarthotel.png)

    > **Note**: If you see the default IIS web application, the default site started before SmartHotel.Registration. RDP to the **smarthotelweb1-test** server (you will need to add a public IP address first), open IIS Manager, stop the default site and start the SmartHotel.Registration site.

#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task you configured the public IP address for the SmartHotel application and verified that the migrated site is working.

### Task 11: Cleanup the test failover

In this task you will cleanup the test failover of the application. This deletes the resources created during the test failover and marks the test failover as complete.

1. Navigate to your Recovery Services Vault in the Azure portal. Click on **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** and select the **SmartHotelRecovery** plan. Click **Cleanup test failover**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Cleanup test failover' button in ASR](Images/Exercise3/cleanup.png)

2. On the **Test failover cleanup** blade, check the **Testing is complete. Delete test failover virtual machine(s).** checkbox and click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Test failover cleanup' blade in ASR](Images/Exercise3/cleanup-2.png)


#### Task summary <!-- omit in toc -->

In this task, you completed the test failover process by cleaning up the test failover resources.

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Clean up resources

Failure to delete the resources created during the lab will result in continued billing.

1.  Delete the resource group containing the SmartHotelHost.

2.  Delete the **SmartHotelDBRG** resource group containing the Azure SQL Database.

3.  Delete the **VaultRG** resource group containing the Recovery Services Vault.
   
4.  Delete the **SmartHotelASRRG** resource group containing the migrated VMs and related infrastructure resources.
   
5.  Delete the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group containing the Azure Migrate resources.


You should complete all of these steps *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
